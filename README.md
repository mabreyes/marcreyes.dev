# ðŸ¤“ XYZ by Marc Reyes

XYZ is a collection of projects I built on my free time.

## Setup
1. Install and use the required version of Ruby on your machine with [RVM](https://rvm.io/).
```sh
rvm install
```

2. Install `jekyll` on your local machine. If you're on a Linux-based machine, go to [this doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/).

3. Install packages
```sh
bundle install
```

4. Modify contents and run server.
```sh
jekyll serve
```

The site can now be accessed at `localhost:4000`. This repo is open source so you can modify this template. However, please make some attributions to me, the owner (plagiarism is bad folks).
